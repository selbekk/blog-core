# My blog backend

This is the backend for my blog. Not a lot to see yet, unfortunately.

## Develop with me

I use ``npm`` as a build tool. Install dependencies with ``npm install``, and use the following command to develop:

    npm start       # Start the backend server
    npm run build   # Build frontend resources
    npm run watch   # Trigger automatic rebuild on file change
